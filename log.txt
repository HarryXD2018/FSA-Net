today I am going to try replace the 2nd stream in the 2-stream structure, and I will try add the 3rd stream
if the d4s2 fail.

d4s2 denotes depth map for 2nd stream.

Todo list:
1. understand how the npz file is made.
2. figure out how the input and two-stream code works.
3. figure out the requirement of the input images.
4. made the RGB-D version npz under the requirement in step 3.
5. training and hopefully it will work.
